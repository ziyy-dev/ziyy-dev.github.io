# \<a>

The `<a>` element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink on the terminal to a URL.

Content within each `<a>` should indicate the link's destination.

> [!WARNING] Styles (the ones Ziyy understands) declared within an `<a>` element are stripped off i.e. by a child tag.
> backslash escapes are not processed. But you can declare styles on the `<a>`element.

## Example

```ziyy
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

## Example that contain a child tag

```ziyy
<a href="https://example.com">Visit Example at <c red>link</c></a>
```

## Example with style

```ziyy
<a href="https://example.com" c="blue" b>Visit Example</a>
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](../globals.mdx).

### `href`
