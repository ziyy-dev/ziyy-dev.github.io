# `<let>`

The `<let>` element is used to define a new custom element in the terminal. It also declares a CSS class. All styles declared on the `<let>` element are added to the new custom element or CSS class. It allows you to create reusable elements with specific styles and behaviors.

`<let>` declarations are scoped to their parent element, meaning that they can be used within the context of the parent element but do not affect other parts of the document.

## Example

```html
<let id="custom" c="blue"> This is a custom element. </let>
```

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](../globals.mdx).

### `id`

The name of the custom element or CSS class.
