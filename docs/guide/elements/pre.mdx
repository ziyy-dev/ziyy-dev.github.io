# `<pre>`

The `<pre>` element is used to display preformatted text. It preserves both spaces and line breaks, making it ideal for displaying code snippets or other text where formatting is important.

## Example

```html
<pre>
    This is preformatted text.
    It preserves whitespace and line breaks.
    You can use it to display code or other text exactly as it is written.
    For example, this text will appear exactly as it is typed,
    including all spaces and line breaks.
</pre>
```

## Attributes

This element only includes the [global attributes](../globals.mdx).
