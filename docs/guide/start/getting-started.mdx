## Basic Usage

To get started with Ziyy, you can create a simple Ziyy file with Ziyy tags. Here's an example:

```html title="example.zy"
<ziyy>
  <p c="red">Hello, World!</p>
  <p c="green">This is a green p.</p>
  <p c="blue">And this is blue.</p>
  <p b="true">This p is bold.</p>
  <p i="true">This p is italic.</p>
  <p u="true">This p is underlined.</p>
  <p s="true">This p is strikethrough.</p>
  <p x="yellow">This p has a yellow background.</p>
</ziyy>
```

Then run:

```bash
ziyy example.zy

```

You should get the following output:

<Output>
  <span style={{ color: "#96004b" }}>Hello, World!</span>
  <span style={{ color: "#00964b" }}>This is a green p.</span>
  <span style={{ color: "#002696" }}>And this is blue.</span>
  <b>This p is bold.</b>
  <i>This p is italic.</i>
  <u>This p is underlined.</u>
  <s>This p is strikethrough.</s>
  <span style={{ backgroundColor: "#969600", color: "black" }}>This p has a yellow background.</span>
</Output>
