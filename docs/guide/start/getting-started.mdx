<ziyy>
  <p c="red">Hello, World!</p>
  <p c="green">This is a green p.</p>
  <p c="blue">And this is blue.</p>
  <p b="true">This p is bold.</p>
  <p i="true">This p is italic.</p>
  <p u="true">This p is underlined.</p>
  <p s="true">This p is strikethrough.</p>
  <p x="yellow">This p has a yellow background.</p>
</ziyy>
```

Then run:

```bash
ziyy simple.zy

```

Or:

```bash
cat simple.zy | ziyy -c
```
