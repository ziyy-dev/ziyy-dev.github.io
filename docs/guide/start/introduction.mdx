# Introduction

Ziyy is a markup language that allows you to style your terminal using HTML-like syntax.
Ziyy uses Ansi escape codes under the hood. With Ziyy you can write:

```ziyy
<b>This is an <d>example</d> text</b>
```

Instesd of:

::ansi::

Definitely easier on the eyes and easier to remember.

You can do even more nesting:

```ziyy title="ziyy"
<b>Lorem
    <d> dolor sit
        <b>amet consectetur
            <d>adipiscing elit</d>
            quisque
        </b>faucibus ex sapien.
```

Noticed that we left some tags unclosed? Ziyy auto closes them for you. I say auto close because Ziyy ensures
that all styles (the ones it recognizes) defined in a document are reset at the end of a document.
You will also notice that whitespaces are collapsed, to preserve whitespace use the `<pre>`tag.

I say HTML-like syntax because Ziyy's syntax it is not fully compliant with HTML,
for example there are no entity tags in Ziyy but you can use regular backslash escapes like those found in C, python, rust, javascript, etc.
Which implies you can write regular Ansi escape codes like this `\x1b[1mThis is an \x1b[22;2mexample\x1b[22;1m text\x1b[22m`.

```ziyy no-ansi
\x1b[1mThis is an \x1b[22;2mexample\x1b[22;1m text\x1b[22m
```

## Why Ziyy?

It started when I first encountered Ansi escape codes while trying to style the output of a program I wrote,
and I thought (would't it be better to use something easier to remember in place of all those weird codes),
After multiply tries and errors I finally arrived at Ziyy 2.0.

## What is Ziyy?

It is an Arabic word that means style.

## Features

What are the features of Ziyy? Lets find out

### HTML-Like syntax

Ziyy uses an HTML-like syntax so anyone with a good knowledge of HTML should find Ziyy familiar.

This is BNF representation of the syntax that Ziyy uses

```
<syntax>          ::= <element> | <element> <syntax>
<element>         ::= <text> | <opt-whitespace> | <self-close-tag> | <open-tag> <element> | <open-tag> <element> <close-tag>
<open-tag>        ::= "<" <identifier> <whitespace> <attributes> ">"
<close-tag>       ::= "<" "/" <identifier> ">"
<self-close-tag>  ::= "<" <identifier> <whitespace> <attributes> "/" ">"
<attributes>      ::= <attribute> <whitespace> <attributes> | <attribute>
<attribute>       ::= <identifier> <opt-whitespace> "=" <opt-whitespace> <string>
<string>          ::= '"' <text> '"' | "'" <text> "'"
<opt-whitespace>  ::= <whitespace> <opt-whitespace> | ""
<whitespace>      ::= " " | "\n" | "\t" | "\x0c" | "\x0d"
```

- `<text>`: Any valid UTF-8 string. Can contain [backslash escapes](#backslash-escapes).
- `<identifier>` Must contain only ASCII upper and lowercase leters, underscores (\_), ASCII numbers,
  and must not begin with an ASCII number. This is the regex `[_A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]*`

### Backslash escapes

Ziyy recognizes backslash escapes. The following is a table of valid escapes in Ziyy:

| Escape     | Resolved To                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| \a         | alert (BEL)                                          |
| \b         | backspace                                            |
| \e         | escape                                               |
| \f         | form feed                                            |
| \n         | new line                                             |
| \r         | carriage return                                      |
| \t         | horizontal tab                                       |
| \v         | vertical tab                                         |
| \\\\       | \\                                                   |
| \\\<       | \<                                                   |
| \\>        | >                                                    |
| \0NNN      | byte with octal value NNN (1 to 3 digits)            |
| \xHH       | byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)       |
| \uHHHH     | 16-bit Unicode character (HHHH is 1 to 4 digits)     |
| \UHHHHHHHH | 32-bit Unicode character (HHHHHHHH is 1 to 8 digits) |

### Ansi escape codes (SGR)

In addition to tags Ziyy also understands Ansi escape codes (SGR).
Ansi escape codes (SGR) can't cross tag boundaries, i.e they are cleared when their parent element closes. For example

```ziyy
<i>Lorem <span>\x1b[1mipsum dolor sit amet \x1b[0m</span>consectetur adipiscing.</i>
```
