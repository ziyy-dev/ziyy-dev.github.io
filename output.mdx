# Introduction

Ziyy is a markup language that allows you to style your terminal using HTML-like syntax.
Ziyy uses Ansi escape codes under the hood. With Ziyy you can write:

```html title="ziyy"
<b>This is an <d>example</d> text</b>
```

Instesd of:

```text title="ansi"
\x1b[1mThis is an \x1b[22;2mexample\x1b[22m text\x1b[22m
```

<Output
  data={"\u001b[1mThis is an \u001b[22;2mexample\u001b[22m text\u001b[22m"}
/>

Definitely easier on the eyes and easier to remember.

You can do even more nesting:

```html title="ziyy" {1,2,3}
<b
  >Lorem
  <d>
    dolor sit
    <b
      >amet consectetur
      <d>adipiscing elit</d>
      quisque </b
    >faucibus ex sapien.</d
  ></b
>
```

```text title="ansi"
\x1b[1mLorem \x1b[22;2mdolor sit \x1b[22;1mamet consectetur \x1b[22;2madipiscing elit\x1b[22m quisque \x1b[22mfaucibus ex sapien.\x1b[22m
```

<Output
  data={
    "\u001b[1mLorem \u001b[22;2mdolor sit \u001b[22;1mamet consectetur \u001b[22;2madipiscing elit\u001b[22m quisque \u001b[22mfaucibus ex sapien.\u001b[22m"
  }
/>

Noticed that we left some tags unclosed? Ziyy auto closes them for you. I say auto close because Ziyy ensures
that all styles (the ones it recognizes) defined in a document are reset at the end of a document.
You will also notice that whitespaces are collapsed, to preserve whitespace use the `<pre>`tag.

I say HTML-like syntax because Ziyy's syntax it is not fully compliant with HTML,
for example there are no entity tags in Ziyy but you can use regular backslash escapes like those found in C, python, rust, javascript, etc.
Which implies you can write regular Ansi escape codes like this `\x1b[1mThis is an \x1b[22;2mexample\x1b[22;1m text\x1b[22m`, but with some
difference. SGR commands can't cross tag boundaries, i.e they are cleared at the closing of their parent tag. For example

```html title="ziyy"
<i
  >Lorem <span>\x1b[1mipsum dolor sit amet \x1b[0m</span>consectetur
  adipiscing.</i
>
```

```text title="ansi"
\x1b[3mLorem \x1b[1mipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing.\x1b[23m
```

<Output
  data={
    "\u001b[3mLorem \u001b[1mipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing.\u001b[23m"
  }
/>

## Why Ziyy?

It started when I first encountered Ansi escape codes while trying to style the output of a program I wrote,
and I thought (would't it be better to use something easier to remember in place of all those weird codes),
After multiply tries and errors I finally arrived at Ziyy 2.0.

## What is Ziyy?

It is an Arabic word that means style.
